### 1/12->1/19: 9 hours.
- Run Pose and Fall Detection Example + Motion and Presence Detection + Understand Radar Setup Code  (5 hours.)
- Troubleshoot mmWave Data Recorder to save data in csv (4 hours.)
### 1/19->1/26: 11 hours.
- Research Data Visualization for heatmap data using matplotlib (2 hours.)
- Research existing TI ML model to understand the dependencies they use and
  also take note of how to write efficient, legible, code in Jupyter Notebook.
  (3 hours.)
- Setup Jupyter Notebook with PyTorch and dataset imports (4 hours.)
- Continue working on Radar configuration to begin dataset collection (2 hours.)
### 1/26->2/02: 19 hours.
- Meeting with TI 3-4 PM on 1/27 (1 hour.)
- Work on creating synthetic range azimuth heatmap data via Python script (3 hours.)
- Work on heatmap config, debug config, attempt to collect heatmap data, notice bug with TI data recorder (3 hours.)
- Met up with team at CpE lab to debug radar heatmap data collection. Try out different configs, edit data recorder source code, schedule meeting with Pedrhom (3 hours.)
- Discuss cfg file with Pedrhom on 1/30 in meeting from 12-1 PM. (1 hour.)
- Got sick with food poisoning on 1/30 from Panda Express... rested 1/30 and 1/31
- Worked on collecting heatmap data and visualizing this data on 2/01. Created json to csv converter that normalized data and collected sitting and standing range azimuth data (5 hours.)
- Continued testing model on range azimuth data on 2/02. (3 hours.)
